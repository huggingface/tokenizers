class TemplateProcessing(PostProcessor):
    """TemplateProcessing

    Provides a way to specify templates in order to add the special tokens to each
    input sequence as relevant.

    Let's take `BERT` tokenizer as an example. It uses two special tokens, used to
    delimitate each sequence. `[CLS]` is always used at the beginning of the first
    sequence, and `[SEP]` is added at the end of both the first, and the pair
    sequences. The final result looks like this:
        - Single sequence: `[CLS] Hello there [SEP]`
        - Pair sequences: `[CLS] My name is Anthony [SEP] What is my name? [SEP]`

    You can achieve such behavior using a TemplateProcessing:
    ```
    TemplateProcessing(
        seq_a="[CLS] $0 [SEP]",
        seq_b="$1 [SEP]",
        special_tokens=[("[CLS]", 1), ("[SEP]", 0)],
    )
    ```

    In this example, $0 and $1 both represent the input sequences. The number in this
    identifier is actually the default type_id that will be used for each sequence. So,
    in this case, the first sequence will use 0, while the pair sequence will use 1.

    Note that we are saying the "default" type_id because each SpecialToken can define
    its own type_id which would override the provided default.

    **Warning**: You must ensure that you are giving the correct tokens/ids as these
    will be added to the Encoding without any further check. If the given ids correspond
    to something totally different in a `Tokenizer` using this `PostProcessor`, it
    might lead to unexpected results.
